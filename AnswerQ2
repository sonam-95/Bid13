What is the mapping function?
Mapping shows how the elements are in relation in which each other. We can create a structure or an array(if similar datatype) to store the mapped variables,
so that they are easy to refer.
Example: 
struct map {
  int key;
  char container[30];
};

Q2 b) What is the output of the mapping function for the following inputs: 30001, 55555, 77788
As there is no data in row A for the matching inputs, the output will be null.
